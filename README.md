# aws-ci-cd-pipeline

Hey there!

this repository is related to building a CI/CD pipeline using AWS resources. Below are the detailed instructions for the same.

Step1 : Clone the repository using below command 

`git clone https://github.com/vinodha17b21/aws-ci-cd-pipeline.git`

the repository once cloned in your local contains a folder named lambda_code which in turn contains all the necessary stuff for
building an operational AWS DevOps Pipeline.

step2 : create a repository on code commit. I personally recommend this option for production ready code because you are not likely to 
share code for multiple third party vendors while you are already doing it blindly trusting AWS.

With AWS we get extra security features as well. I spoke more on this in my youtube channel. will paste the link here soon.

Step3: after replicating your code over there create AWS Pipeline following my tutorial below (link will be posted soon).
